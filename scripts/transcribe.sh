# This script is designed to be run by a hotkey.
# - On first press: starts recording audio.
# - On second press (while recording): stops the recording.
# 
# How it works:
# - The first script instance starts ffmpeg and waits for it to finish (either by timeout or being killed).
# - If a second instance is started (by pressing the hotkey again), it detects ffmpeg is running, kills it, and exits.
# - The first instance resumes after ffmpeg exits (whether by timeout or being killed), and continues to process and transcribe the audio.

# Check if ffmpeg is already recording our file (i.e., recording is in progress)
